# Movie-ticket-booking-system
A computer booking system is a system whereby publicly accessible computers can be reserved for a period of time. These systems are commonly used in facilities such as public libraries to ensure equitable use of limited numbers of computers. Bookings may be done over the Internet or within the library itself using a web browser. Computer booking systems allow public service with reduced staff involvement.
Typically a computer booking system consists of both server and client software. The server software might run within the LAN or more typically is run from a publicly accessible web-server thus enabling users to book or reserve their computer time from their web-browser. There are both commercial and Open Source computer booking products on the market..
Anybody who has a smartphone can do the movie ticket booking in a very short time. Today there are many apps which can be downloaded easily on your phone for the movie ticket coupons. When entering the theatre, you just have to bring along your identification proof and after the viewing of the booking data on your phone, you will be provided with actual printed tickets on the spot.
Another big advantage is the convenience of payment. Through online sites and apps, your payment can be completed instantly through various methods. You can use credit cards, debit cards and even net banking. These are completely safe and secure and there is no need to worry at all.
